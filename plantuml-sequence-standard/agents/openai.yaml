  display_name: PlantUML Sequence Standard
  short_description: Enforce strict conventions for PlantUML sequence diagrams in -seq.puml files, excluding activity/swimlane/state diagrams.
  default_prompt: >-
    Create or edit a PlantUML sequence diagram using this standard. Apply only
    to files ending with -seq.puml, enforce one return per -> message, group
    color syntax, and 2-space indentation rules. If content is activity,
    swimlane, or state-transition style, do not apply this skill.
